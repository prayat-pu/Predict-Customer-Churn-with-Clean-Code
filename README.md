# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
In this project, I have developed a machine learning pipeline designed to predict customer churn. This pipeline encompasses several critical stages, including data acquisition, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, as well as the training and evaluation of the model. Additionally, I conducted a comparative analysis of the performance metrics between Random Forest and Logistic Regression algorithms. Furthermore, comprehensive tests have been implemented for all functions within the pipeline. All pertinent information and processes are meticulously documented and stored in the 'log' folder.

## Files and data description
- *images* Folder: This repository contains images pertinent to data analysis and visuals representing the outcomes of the machine learning model.
- *logs* Folder: This section archives log information generated during the execution of the pipeline.
- *models* Folder: This compartment stores the machine learning models developed within the pipeline.
- *requirements_py3.6.txt* and *requirements_py3.8.txt* Files: These documents list the libraries employed in the machine learning pipeline, tailored for Python 3.6 and Python 3.8, respectively.
- *churn_library.py*: This is the Python script encompassing the entire machine learning pipeline.
- *churn_script_logging_and_tests.py*: A Python script for logging and testing of churn_library.py.
- *churn_notebook.ipynb*: This Jupyter notebook file encapsulates the machine learning pipeline, as provided by Udacity.
